# Readme Lauberhorn
This projet was created as  part of the module R-Bootcamp assignment.


## Basic overwiew
The Lauberhorn is a file about, to see if there are any visible correlation to the age of athletes and the ranking at the yearly Lauberhorn race which takes place mid January in Switzerland.
We restricted the findings of the race only to the Downhill challenge and also we also only looked at male athletes.
